# Linear Regression Model

## Objective
This project aims to build a simple Linear Regression model to predict a numerical target value based on a single feature. The model is implemented using the scikit-learn library and evaluated for its performance.

## Dataset
A synthetic dataset with 100 samples is created for the purpose of this task. The dataset consists of:
- **Feature**: A numerical value ranging from 1 to 100.
- **Target**: A target variable generated based on the feature with added Gaussian noise to simulate real-world data variability.

## Requirements
Make sure to install the following libraries if they are not already installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
