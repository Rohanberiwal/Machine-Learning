# RCNN for Object Detection on Cell Histopathology Data

## Overview

This repository contains a custom implementation of a Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) tailored for object detection tasks. The model has been specifically trained on cell histopathology data to identify and classify various objects within histopathology images. The approach leverages feature maps extracted from the dataset, followed by a series of custom modules for accurate classification.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rcnn-cell-histopathology.git
    cd rcnn-cell-histopathology

## Dataset

### Description

The dataset used for training consists of cell histopathology images, annotated with bounding boxes and corresponding class labels. 

### Format

- **Images**: JPEG or PNG format
- **Annotations**: XML files (PASCAL VOC format) or JSON files (COCO format)

### Preparation

1. Download and organize the dataset into the following directory structure:

    ```
    /data
        /images
        /annotations
    ```

2. Adjust paths in the configuration file `config.py` to point to your dataset directories.

## Model Architecture

### Feature Extraction

The model begins with a feature extraction network (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) to extract feature maps from the input images.

### Region Proposal Network (RPN)

The RPN generates candidate regions (proposals) from the feature maps that are likely to contain objects.

### RoI Pooling

Regions of Interest (RoIs) are pooled to a fixed size for further processing.

### Classification and Bounding Box Regression

The pooled features are passed through fully connected layers to classify objects and refine bounding box predictions.

### Custom RCNN Modules

- **Feature Map Extraction**: Custom layers and configurations to better capture cell histopathology features.
- **Classification Head**: A tailored classification head specific to the classes in the histopathology dataset.
- **Bounding Box Refinement**: Enhanced techniques for refining bounding boxes based on custom metrics.

## Training

### Configuration

Modify the `config.py` file to set training parameters, such as learning rate, number of epochs, batch size, and paths to the dataset.

### Command

To start training, use the following command:

    python train.py --config config.py

Ensure that the training script `train.py` is properly configured to handle data loading, model training, and checkpointing.

## Evaluation

### Metrics

The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated based on common object detection metrics, such as:

- Precision
- Recall
- Intersection over Union (IoU)
- Mean Average Precision (mAP)

### Command

To evaluate the trained model, run:

    python evaluate.py --config config.py --model path/to/trained/model

Results will be saved in the `results/` directory.

## Usage

To perform object detection on new images using the trained model, execute:

    python detect.py --config config.py --model path/to/trained/model --image path/to/input/image

The output will include visualizations of detected objects and their corresponding bounding boxes.
