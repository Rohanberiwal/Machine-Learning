# Distributed and Federated Machine Learning

## Introduction
Distributed and Federated Machine Learning are approaches designed to handle large-scale data and computational tasks more efficiently, while also addressing privacy and data governance concerns.

- **Distributed Machine Learning** involves distributing the training process across multiple machines or nodes to speed up computation and manage large datasets.

- **Federated Machine Learning** focuses on training models across decentralized devices or servers where data remains local, enhancing privacy and compliance with data protection regulations.

## Distributed Machine Learning

### Key Concepts

- **Distributed Training**: The process of training a machine learning model across multiple machines or nodes. This allows for handling larger datasets and faster computation by parallelizing the training process.

- **Data Parallelism**: Splitting the dataset into smaller chunks and training the model on each chunk simultaneously. Gradients are then aggregated to update the model parameters.

- **Model Parallelism**: Splitting the model itself into different parts and training each part on different machines.

### Popular Frameworks

- **Apache Spark MLlib**: A scalable machine learning library built on top of Apache Spark for large-scale data processing.

- **TensorFlow**: Offers distributed training capabilities through its `tf.distribute` module.

- **PyTorch**: Provides distributed training via the `torch.distributed` package.

### Sample Code

Hereâ€™s an example using TensorFlow for distributed training:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
from tensorflow.distribute import MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy

# Setup distributed strategy
strategy = MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy()

# Load dataset
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0

# Build model
def create_model():
    model = Sequential([
        Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
        Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
                  metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

with strategy.scope():
    model = create_model()

# Train model
x_train = x_train.reshape((-1, 784))
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=64, validation_split=0.2)

# Evaluate model
x_test = x_test.reshape((-1, 784))
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print(f'Test accuracy: {test_acc}')
