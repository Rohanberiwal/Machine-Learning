# Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Overview
This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification tasks. SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression analysis. It works by finding the hyperplane that best separates the data points of different classes in a high-dimensional space.

## Features
- Binary classification
- Multi-class classification support
- Kernel trick for non-linear classification
- Visualization of decision boundaries

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Installation
To install the necessary packages, run:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
